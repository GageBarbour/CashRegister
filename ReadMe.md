### If you want to help or are interested in the final product please contact barbourgage@gmail.com

### About
This is a project to set up a order system for like a concession stand. However due to the limits of PHP there will be no automatic drawer opening. This is just to aid in the order taking possess and keep track of
inventory and customer info.

### Idea

A local printing business just keeps all of the PDFs for files in one big folder with no organization. I wanted to look
at this problem and see if there was a way to keep better track of it.

There is also a restaurant that my father works at. I'm hoping to make it versatile enough to help keep track more like
a POS system. With table numbers and usual customers. They would be able to display tickets to the kitchen via screen to
prepare orders and then be able to click done when they finish one. I would also like to make it so some regular customers
can input their order online and have it show up as well.

### Goals
- Create printable receipt
- Keep customer info on hand
    - Set up royalty ability
- Easy to use
- Upload files plugin
- Create completely modularized
    - To make it more pick and choose your own program

### Coding Standards
- All variables will be like so:
    - One word: ``` $customer ```
    - Two words: ``` $customerName ```
